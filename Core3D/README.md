Believotronics is a low-cost DIY open source robotics platform you can print and build at work or from home. The Core3D project is a refactoring of all our 3D objects. The original proof of concept was generated using proprietary CAD software and we are converting all the objects to OpenSCAD.

We're going to start with the basic rack and pinion + rack hugger and convert everything needed for the basic MicroscopeBot.

Phase 2 (Current):
We are currently cleaning up the entire Believotronics Github repo. We're making sure all the existing models are in the repo as-is before we start the conversion.

Phase 3: (MVP Model of MicroscopeBot core components)

---
Phase 1 (Complete): Create proof of concept using any CAD tool

Phase 0 (Complete): Test the ability for a 3D Printer to create interlocking rack and pinon system.
