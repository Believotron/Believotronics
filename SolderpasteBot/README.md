Believotronics is a low-cost DIY open source robotics platform you can print and build at work or from home. The SolderpasteBot allows you to despense glues, fluids, and pastes in an even, repeatable amount and pattern.

Phase 0 (Current): Pause
This project is on hold until the [Core3D](/Core3D/readme.md) refactoring project is complete.
We've done a proof of concept manually holding the toolhead and we are ready to start testing dispensing as soon as the Core3D is refactored.

We've been experimenting with various stepper motors, and we believe that we will have to use an upgraded NEMA motor to handle the increased pressure from fluid/paste dynamics. SCIENCE!
