Believotronics is a low-cost DIY open source robotics platform you can print and build at work or from home. Our first projects are a MicroscopeBot and a ThroughholeSolderBot.

We also develop mechatronics, jigs, firmware, assemblies, etc. Your basic toolkit for interfacing the physical world with the software world, allowing software to exist in physical space. Robots building robots. That sort of thing.

The current focus of the project is the [OpenSCAD Refactor](/Core3D/readme.md). We've designed the proof of concept using proprietary CAD tools, and now we'd like to convert them all to OpenSCAD, allowing for a much more flexible, modular, and ultimately scalable solution. Once we have the core system redesiged, we will start refactoring the [MircoscopeBot](/MircoscopeBot/.readme), and then then proceed with the [ThroughholeSolderBot](/ThroughholeSolderBot/readme.md)
