Believotronics is a low-cost DIY open source robotics platform you can print and build at work or from home. The ThroughholeSolderbot allows you to solder rugged and durable through-hole components such as joysticks, knobs, and connectors. Spend less time building and more time designing.

Phase 0 (Current): Pause
This project is on hold until the [Core3D](/Core3D/readme.md) refactoring project is complete.

We've done a proof of concept manually holding the toolhead and we are ready to start testing dispensing as soon as the [Core3D](/Core3D/readme.md) is refactored.

We have equipment to feed and guide the solder and will be spending a majority of the time sciencing the angle and movement of the hot end and the solder feed. SCIENCE!
